# DownloadInterfacewithBrowserOSandCClampTemp
This PHP project builds on an earlier one where I created a page with a "Download Now!" button. Added a C Clamp template and live download link.

Here are the specs for this project:

This is building on an earlier project where I created an Acme, Inc. page in PHP which displayed a "Download Now!" link if a user met certain environmental criteria. 

Now alter this program to include the Acme C-Clamp template. 

In addition, make the "Download Now!" link live, so that users who click on it download a file of your choice.
